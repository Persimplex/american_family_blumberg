# American Family Robinson
I grew up loving to read the fantastic survival story of Swiss Family Robinson. This game is an homage to that great novel, Red Mars, The Martian, and every other great science fiction novel that pits human ingenuity against the great threat of the unconquered wild. 

This game is written in Java 1.8 and makes heavy use of JavaFX. 

Enjoy :)
